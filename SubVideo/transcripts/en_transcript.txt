In each region of the world, people use
a different language. For example, in
this place, it is called PIN Chi Linh,
where it is called 300 calories, full of sugar in
chemicals, where it is called a
bad solution when you are in love.  Although each country
has a different language, but
all in common, laughter
is an act of expressing an emotional state of
comfort, joy, agreement,
sometimes sneer, to show disdain.
Because it's a way to express emotions
, you can laugh at any time while
going to the toilet laughing and pooping when it's ridiculously hot
while drying clothes, it's funny, it's
the same when you're a defender of MU When the

people call it funny that you lose a lot, causing a lot of

from a scientific point of view, laughing is a
type of reflex caused by rhythmic muscle contraction that
emits sounds and sounds.  If not
voluntarily controlled by a nerve center on the
brain over thousands of years of
evolution, the human skin becomes
smoother, weaker, better before the
effects of the environment, leading to the
appearance of many sensitive points in the body.  I feel that it
is quite contradictory that people with
sad blood are easy to laugh even
when they eat snacks, it means that they don't know
the concept. Usually, lazy people can
also laugh, not hardworking people

Pepsi, Van Van and clouds, people
often want to live a life.  Optimistic
love life is always full of laughter
but life is constantly
developing pressure to eat rice and money makes
people want to have more joys
instead of a fake smile Just to
communicate and serve  For work, that's
why a lot of entertainment content was born
with the purpose of causing laughter, collectively known as comedy
[Laughter],
called what people wear under their feet, their noses
are curved up, but these
days it's rare.  put on this shoe too I guess only comedians can wear these The
type of comedy performance is not limited
to musical skits, game shows,
stand-up comedy or just plain
gossip As long as  If others
laugh, it's okay, in fact, any profession can
do comedy like kicking a soccer
ball, but when it comes to comedy, people will laugh at it.
Whether this is a problem or a little brother who writes
jokes, people call them skeletons. In
general, funny jokes are
based on many factors, the first is the
contradiction in communication When the
respondent intentionally  I understand the point of the question
. The third example still lost an arm Yeah but I
don't have your hand. The
second is the kind of insight that
tells funny stories like this, usually only a
part of people can understand.  For example,
before about MU, only those who watch
football will understand the slope of anime, only
wibu will understand the nature with cells, surely
anyone will understand
besides that because the artistic methods
applied skillfully
also create  Therefore, the humor in each
work in Vietnam is divided into three
main types, the first is the North Sea in the
past, which was performed regularly every week, called "
Meet the Weekend Near New Year", there
was a Tet comedy program and "Meet each other".  At the end of the
year in the North, every Spring Festival coming back to
see Tet comedy and Tao Quan can be considered
a cultural feature by the small characters.
Northern comedy often brings satirical content that
brings a satirical and poignant smile,
then viewers often have to
think to realize the humor
as well as the lesson hidden deep behind the
comedy skit, so it's funny.  In the North, you often
have to prepare to elaborate on sentences from
story situations as well as
quickly update hot events
in the past, but now, when Exorcist Troopers come
out, all comedies show off girls with
ads.  In contrast to the two Norths,
we have two Souths that usually take place
all year round and are diverse. Entertainment content
with amusing skits with
interesting Nghiem Chau such as the voice of a
man or the Challenge of Comedians.
Southern comedy is amusing because of its
direct simplicity and easy to understand
Southern audience is generally more receptive
than Northern audience But whether it is
North or South, there are interesting
features.  each region's own, that is, it
is extremely lame to compare the harmonies between the two regions.
Besides,
Typical famous comedians
such as Xuan Hinh Truong Giang
Cong Ly Tu Long Hoai Linh cheerful Xuan
Bac sincere and so on with grace
and humor put into each work
, no matter what region.  when watching to support or in
addition to the two types of comedy mentioned above,
we have another form called crotch
Because this kind of comedy is quite [ __ ] it's just like the
editor based on that editor adds a
bunch of jerky editing sound effects
boom boom, the actor only needs to say one sentence
, but add a cross behind like a
fake fake podium Trang is two Okay, this
Amada
[music]
has two sides to it,
laughter isn't always  also
bring fun sometimes it has
serious consequences especially for the
villains in anime And if you laugh too
much then you can get
stomach cramps bleeding gums pain
around the mouth area If  if you laugh at the
wrong place, you are considered
ungrateful If you laugh at this video
then  It's actually funny
, it's really harmful but it's not fun.
Sometimes if you laugh just one, you will
be sent to hell because if you laugh
once, you will find yourself in Thanh Hoa, the line
between humor and nonsense.  Charm is extremely
fragile, especially be careful in your
words and laughter when
flirting, just imitate Chi Pheo I
just want to see your smile bloom and when
you're confused, that's when I want to marry you
then let the other party feel happy because of
your witty humor,
not make yourself a good
joke haha
