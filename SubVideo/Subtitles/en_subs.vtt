00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
In each region of the world, people use

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.020
a different language. For example, in

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.120
this place, it is called PIN Chi Linh,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.280
where it is called 300 calories, full of sugar in

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.840
chemicals, where it is called a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.760
bad solution when you are in love.  Although each country

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.559
has a different language, but

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.440
all in common, laughter

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.119
is an act of expressing an emotional state of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.640
comfort, joy, agreement,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.260
sometimes sneer, to show disdain.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.660
Because it's a way to express emotions

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.760
, you can laugh at any time while

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.060
going to the toilet laughing and pooping when it's ridiculously hot

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.579
while drying clothes, it's funny, it's

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.860
the same when you're a defender of MU When the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.780
team  If you support to lose to a stronger team,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.280
people call it funny that you lose a lot, causing a lot of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.260
debt, you go to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.239
the bridges with the hope of reincarnation when

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.059
jumping but still smiling, then laugh and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.100
then laugh and laugh.  Finally, laughing is dead

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.079
from a scientific point of view, laughing is a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.480
type of reflex caused by rhythmic muscle contraction that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.520
emits sounds and sounds.  If not

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.260
voluntarily controlled by a nerve center on the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.120
brain over thousands of years of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.039
evolution, the human skin becomes

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.719
smoother, weaker, better before the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.820
effects of the environment, leading to the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.500
appearance of many sensitive points in the body.  I feel that it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.360
is quite contradictory that people with

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.640
sad blood are easy to laugh even

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.400
when they eat snacks, it means that they don't know

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.720
the concept. Usually, lazy people can

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.820
also laugh, not hardworking people

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.100
.  laugh If you don't know where laughter comes

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.080

comment back to the video, there are quite a few

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.140
different types of smiles, there are quite a few different types of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.879
smiles that allow us to

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.620
flexibly use in each communication situation.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.540
Of course you don't have

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.640
to gag for 60 minutes to have a laugh

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.920
if it's normal fun  g then smile with

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.660
colons and brackets, it's not

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.379
very funny but friendly.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.660
parentheses are contempt

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.220
, not laughter, or if you laugh

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.080
like that, it's extremely misleading for the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.940
person you're talking to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.800
, and there are many other types of laughter

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.959
shared by comedians such as laughter

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.120
pop the cork and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.739
laugh like a horse,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.819
laugh like a fake but it's great but still good to

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.620
write, laughter is described

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.840
by combining the consonants h and k with all

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.019
the abstract vowels like hi hi he he ho

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.220
ho  hahaki Kaka Coco the last one Probably

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.900
only Doan Chi Binh can laugh there

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.819
is no one who can't laugh except for some crazy kingdom

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.440
in

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.480
the 4th grade Vietnamese textbooks, there's something quite

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.700
interesting in other countries.  When

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.099
they smile in English, they often have to stroke the turtle.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.440
Because then they smile or want to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.480
laugh  o then smiling LOL is sometimes more

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.519
important than talking Because children

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.680
laugh before they can talk and sometimes in

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.599
awkward situations like a

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.400
confident smile when they cry when they are born

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.080
babies cry  When you grow up,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.420
people often say how to live so that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.000
when you die, people around you laugh

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.700
and cry and bury you and bury something

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.200
important, spreading laughter brings a

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.120
lot of benefits such as reducing stress, dispelling stress.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.640
stress Because when smiling, the body will release

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.200
happiness hormone when we feel

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.480
comfortable and comfortable there is a saying that a smile is

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.099
equal to ten tonics But

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.900
in my opinion, it must be a smile equal to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.940
ten cold medicines.  Because when smiling

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.620
inside, the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, nervous system

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.480
and many other organs are affected

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.159
in a positive way Besides, laughing

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.840
helps to relax muscles and blood circulation better

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.580
than scientific research has shown.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.860
laughing 100 times is equivalent to 1 minute of

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.900
rowing or 15 minutes of riding a bicycle That

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.819
is just smiling  You can also

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.560
lose weight that's why people who are

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.720
addicted to being so skinny don't stop laughing, it's also how

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.820
we connect with society and the things

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.500
around us, the more people laugh, the more people

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.180
around you feel like you're

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.919
friendly  a crazy person and can

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.960
easily connect with each other even if it's a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.520
hundred million If it's funny That's the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.199
right place, today I'll sit here and

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.000
say the person I don't want to say the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.440
name of you guys, I

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.500
nicknamed the troll god, your

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.940
smile will also improve the beauty of every

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.460
person who meets you, see you smile well, see the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.560
birth of your eyes, see your cheeks, or do you

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.600
obediently buy a smile and look at the man

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.820
without regret Your smile  Being pretty through

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.440
laughter we also learn a

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.780
lot of things like who do not rush to laugh at each other

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.699
the day before, you will still laugh the next day,

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.020
but it must be a little less happy

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.880
Because the way you go downhill, you will be

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.600
less sad  laugh it off

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.979
IC wedding whoever laughs at the ghost wedding

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.900
deserves to be ridiculed Because it's a

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.820
custom and type b  In the summer, the days are short, the nights are

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.919
long in the winter, the days are long and the nights are short,

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.840
people say that the night of May

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.600
has not yet fallen, the morning of October has not yet laughed,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.120
Pepsi, Van Van and clouds, people

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.440
often want to live a life.  Optimistic

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.540
love life is always full of laughter

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.400
but life is constantly

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.560
developing pressure to eat rice and money makes

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.940
people want to have more joys

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.160
instead of a fake smile Just to

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.960
communicate and serve  For work, that's

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.639
why a lot of entertainment content was born

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.360
with the purpose of causing laughter, collectively known as comedy

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.960
[Laughter],

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.580
called what people wear under their feet, their noses

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.320
are curved up, but these

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.900
days it's rare.  put on this shoe too I guess only comedians can wear these The

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.979
type of comedy performance is not limited

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.500
to musical skits, game shows,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.419
stand-up comedy or just plain

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.520
gossip As long as  If others

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.440
laugh, it's okay, in fact, any profession can

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.840
do comedy like kicking a soccer

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.639
ball, but when it comes to comedy, people will laugh at it.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.800
Whether this is a problem or a little brother who writes

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.259
jokes, people call them skeletons. In

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.699
general, funny jokes are

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.160
based on many factors, the first is the

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.660
contradiction in communication When the

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.180
respondent intentionally  I understand the point of the question

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.400
. The third example still lost an arm Yeah but I

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.240
don't have your hand. The

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.360
second is the kind of insight that

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.979
tells funny stories like this, usually only a

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.720
part of people can understand.  For example,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.759
before about MU, only those who watch

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.860
football will understand the slope of anime, only

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.840
wibu will understand the nature with cells, surely

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.180
anyone will understand

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.380
besides that because the artistic methods

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.120
applied skillfully

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.979
also create  Therefore, the humor in each

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.259
work in Vietnam is divided into three

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.479
main types, the first is the North Sea in the

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.340
past, which was performed regularly every week, called "

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.380
Meet the Weekend Near New Year", there

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.819
was a Tet comedy program and "Meet each other".  At the end of the

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.860
year in the North, every Spring Festival coming back to

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.080
see Tet comedy and Tao Quan can be considered

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.819
a cultural feature by the small characters.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.620
Northern comedy often brings satirical content that

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.780
brings a satirical and poignant smile,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.580
then viewers often have to

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.139
think to realize the humor

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.060
as well as the lesson hidden deep behind the

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.800
comedy skit, so it's funny.  In the North, you often

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.479
have to prepare to elaborate on sentences from

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.039
story situations as well as

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.660
quickly update hot events

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.220
in the past, but now, when Exorcist Troopers come

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.259
out, all comedies show off girls with

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.300
ads.  In contrast to the two Norths,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.220
we have two Souths that usually take place

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.840
all year round and are diverse. Entertainment content

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.699
with amusing skits with

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:25.319
interesting Nghiem Chau such as the voice of a

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.419
man or the Challenge of Comedians.

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:29.039
Southern comedy is amusing because of its

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.319
direct simplicity and easy to understand

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.240
Southern audience is generally more receptive

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.099
than Northern audience But whether it is

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.139
North or South, there are interesting

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.940
features.  each region's own, that is, it

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.979
is extremely lame to compare the harmonies between the two regions.

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.479
Besides,

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.400
Typical famous comedians

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.020
such as Xuan Hinh Truong Giang

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.780
Cong Ly Tu Long Hoai Linh cheerful Xuan

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.180
Bac sincere and so on with grace

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.979
and humor put into each work

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:55.560
, no matter what region.  when watching to support or in

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.840
addition to the two types of comedy mentioned above,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.479
we have another form called crotch

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.360
Because this kind of comedy is quite [ __ ] it's just like the

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.160
editor based on that editor adds a

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.780
bunch of jerky editing sound effects

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.580
boom boom, the actor only needs to say one sentence

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.340
, but add a cross behind like a

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.840
fake fake podium Trang is two Okay, this

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.840
Amada

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.370
[music]

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.000
has two sides to it,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.200
laughter isn't always  also

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.240
bring fun sometimes it has

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.800
serious consequences especially for the

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.839
villains in anime And if you laugh too

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.640
much then you can get

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.440
stomach cramps bleeding gums pain

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.240
around the mouth area If  if you laugh at the

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.220
wrong place, you are considered

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.620
ungrateful If you laugh at this video

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.640
then  It's actually funny

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:00.899
, it's really harmful but it's not fun.

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:03.540
Sometimes if you laugh just one, you will

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.339
be sent to hell because if you laugh

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:07.260
once, you will find yourself in Thanh Hoa, the line

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.240
between humor and nonsense.  Charm is extremely

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.740
fragile, especially be careful in your

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.779
words and laughter when

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:14.640
flirting, just imitate Chi Pheo I

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.860
just want to see your smile bloom and when

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.899
you're confused, that's when I want to marry you

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:21.480
then let the other party feel happy because of

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.399
your witty humor,

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:24.839
not make yourself a good

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:27.680
joke haha
